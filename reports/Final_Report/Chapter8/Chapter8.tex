\chapter{Project Management}

What is the timeline for your project? What software development
methodology will you use? Can you identify the major milestones? These types of questions are
important for project planning and should be addressed directly.

\begin{itemize}
\item Gantt chart 
\item Weekly updates with supervisor 
\item Getting the s-expression extractor was a major milestone 
\item Using python instead of clojure was a significant improvement
\end{itemize}
