\chapter{Conclusion}

Generally speaking, section can take different forms - as a minimum you would
normally provide a brief summary of your project work and a discussion of possible future work. You
may also wish to reiterate the main outcomes of your project and give some idea of how you think
the ideas dealt with by your project relate to real-world situations, etc.. For the Proposal, donâ€™t
mention future work but do summarise your document.
