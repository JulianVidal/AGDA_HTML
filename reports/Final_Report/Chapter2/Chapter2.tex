\chapter{Research}

This is often referred to the ‘literature review’ section. It is one of the most important
section of the Project Proposal and the Project Report. It is where you demonstrate that you
understand the state-of-the-art in the field you’re working. Towards the end of this sections it’s
normally a good idea to explain how your aim / work / idea / contribution differs from the nearest
work in the field.
