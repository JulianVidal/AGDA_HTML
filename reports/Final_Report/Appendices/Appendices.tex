\chapter{Appendix}

% Some information, for example program listings, is useful to include within the report
% for completeness, but would distract the reader from the flow of the discussion if it were included
% within the body of the document. Short extracts from major programs may be included to illustrate
% points but full program listings should only ever be placed within an appendix. Remember that the
% point of appendices is to make your report more readable. I donâ€™t expect to see apprentices in any
% Project Proposals.
