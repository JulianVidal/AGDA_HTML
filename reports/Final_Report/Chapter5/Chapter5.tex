\chapter{Design}

Communicating how you think about the composition of your system and how it works. You
might detail the ways in which the overall system will be broken down into subsystems. Detail should
then be provided on the design of each of these subsystems.

\begin{itemize}
\item A system that turns agda into s-expressions 
\item A system that reads s-expressions and turns it into a graph 
\item A system that queries that graph 
\item A way to store the graph for future use
\end{itemize}
