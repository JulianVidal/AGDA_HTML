\chapter{Testing and Success Measurement}

As well as documenting system testing, this section should also
describe any unit testing or integration testing performed. If you are not familiar with unit, integration or
system testing then it would be a good idea to investigate these notions and consider about how they
relate to your project. This section might also detail any performance, reliability or usability testing
performed, with quantification, i.e., numeric measurements, being used wherever possible. All those points
are systems focused through. If you’re doing something that’s research focused or more of a social /
analytical study then you need to think about how you’ll measure success.
