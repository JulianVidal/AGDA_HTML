\chapter{Project Management}

The timeline of the project can be seen in the below Gantt chart
\cref{fig:Gantt}. The focus on the first 2 months was on writing Agda Tree and
Agda Comp. For Agda Tree, the first milestone is to parse the Agda project to
extract the definition dependency graph. The next milestone is to implement the
queries that analyse the dependency graph. Once the queries were implemented,
the last milestone is the Command Line Interface created that gives the user a
way to run those queries with their own parameters. Lastly, the queries were
unit tested for correctness and tested for performance. This is done by the
date of the demonstration, which is a major milestone as it marked the first
stable version of the CLI tools.

While developing Agda Tree, Agda Comp is also being developed. The first task
of Agda Comp is to explore the compilation strategies that could be used and
different methods to compile an Agda project. Once the strategies are selected,
they are tested for correctness, safety and compilation performance which is a
major milestone. With the strategies implemented then, the CLI is created that
automatically runs the strategy and the compilation. This is done by the date
of the demonstration.

An agile software development methodology was used, as seen by the time-line
there are multiple tasks running at the same time until they are all completed
by the demonstration. There were weekly meetings with my supervisor were a
working state of the project was shown along with a summary of all the
accomplishments since the previous week, and my supervisor gives suggestions on
changes and improvement for next week. This iterative approach allowed for the
tools to be quickly created for my supervisor to test.

% What is the timeline for your project? What software development
% methodology will you use? Can you identify the major milestones? These types of questions are
% important for project planning and should be addressed directly.
