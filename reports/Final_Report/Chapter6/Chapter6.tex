\chapter{Implementation}

This section should discuss how you went about developing a system that was
consistent with your design to meet your stated requirements. The implementation of subsystems should
be accurately documented, with any implementation difficulties being acknowledged. The Design and
Implementation sections can be grouped in the Project Report, if these are tightly coupled. Likely omitted
for the Project Proposal, though should mention your proposed implementation technologies somewhere.
