\chapter{System Requirements}

This section should detail your understanding of what you are planning to
create. The section should aim to break down the overarching aims of the work into clear,
measurable requirements that can be used in the evaluation of the project. This is why we often
function of functional and non-functional requirements.

\begin{itemize}
\item Explain what the project should do and how it should do it 
\item Functional requirements
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create graph from agda project
    \item Should allow for asked queries (the ones mentioned in the Mathodon thread)
    \item Reduce compilation time by 10\%? 
    \end{itemize} 
\item Non-Functional requirements
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Installation shouldn't be difficult
    \item Queries should be done in under 2 seconds 
    \item Creation of the graph shouldn't take more than 10 minutes 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
