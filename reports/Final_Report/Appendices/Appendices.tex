\chapter{Appendix}

Some information, for example program listings, is useful to include within the report
for completeness, but would distract the reader from the flow of the discussion if it were included
within the body of the document. Short extracts from major programs may be included to illustrate
points but full program listings should only ever be placed within an appendix. Remember that the
point of appendices is to make your report more readable. I donâ€™t expect to see apprentices in any
Project Proposals.
