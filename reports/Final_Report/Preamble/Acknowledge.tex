I would like to express my gratitude to Andrej Bauer, the creator of the Agda
s-expression extractor, and Job Petrovčič for their invaluable assistance in
helping me use and understand the extractor. Their guidance contributed
significantly to the overall success of this thesis. Their expertise and
support have been greatly appreciated.
