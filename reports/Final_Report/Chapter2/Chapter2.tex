\chapter{Research}

This is often referred to the ‘literature review’ section. It is one of the most important
section of the Project Proposal and the Project Report. It is where you demonstrate that you
understand the state-of-the-art in the field you’re working. Towards the end of this sections it’s
normally a good idea to explain how your aim / work / idea / contribution differs from the nearest
work in the field.

Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), Control Flow Graph (CFG), Data Flow Graph (DFG), Program Dependence Graph (PDG), and Code Property Graph (CPG),

Research papers to explore:
\begin{itemize}
    \item State of the art in dependency graph extraction 
    \item state of the art in dependency graph exploration
    \item State of the art in Agda compilation 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item s-expressions 
\item How graphs can be used to represent the definitions
\item Most tools focus on data-flow for static analysis, I am looking
    for a simpler tools that allows the querying of the relationships between
    definitions.
\end{itemize}

Tools that do a similar job
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags}{CTags}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item CTags indexes all the symbols of a project
    \item This works only on definitions of functions, not where they are referenced
    \end{itemize}
\item \href{https://jedi.readthedocs.io/}{Jedi - an awesome autocompletion, static analysis and refactoring library for Python}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It finds function definitions and references which is what we are looking
        for
    \end{itemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/agda/agda-language-server/tree/master}{Agda-Language-Server}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item An LSP for agda, it parses the files and analysis them, similar to what we
        want but it doesn't seem to index them
    \end{itemize}
\item \href{https://cormack.uwaterloo.ca/~olhotak/pubs/ecoop12.pdf}{Application-only Call Graph Construction }
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A call graph represents the relationships between functions
    \end{itemize}
\item \href{https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/199448.199462}{Precise Interprocedural Dataflow Analysis via Graph Reachabilit}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Data flow is a way to statically analyse code before running it, this is
        far more complex than what I want.
    \end{itemize}
\item \href{https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3583660.3583664}{CFL/Dyck Reachability: An Algorithmic Perspective}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Analyses the decidability and complexity of this problem
    \end{itemize}
